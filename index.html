					Hello, I'm Nathan! Welcome to my portfolio page! Here, you can learn all sorts of things 
					about who I am and what I do. Let's get started! 
					<br>
					<br>
					I was the kid that always wanted to explore something new, like trying to make plasma by microwaving a 
					grape. Now, instead of breaking microwaves, I'm striving to create without the destructive side 
					effects. When the time came for college, I ended up choosing to study computer engineering, where 
					most of my accidental unwanted side effects could be fixed with a 'Ctrl+C' or a 'git revert', but where 
					I still have the opportunity to make objects light up, process outputs of ultrasonic sensors, and 
					just interact with the physical world with the things I build (even if a few LEDs or resistors are 
					sacrificed in the process). Now, I'm starting my third and final year for my Bachelor's degree, and 
					I'm on track to complete my Master's degree in computer engineering by Spring of 2022. 
					<br>
					<br>
					My current interest resides in finding and understanding the applications of theoretical principles 
					that I am learning about in my courses. I find abstract notions to be wonderful to think about, I 
					believe that the true beauty of these theoretical concepts is how they can be applied to our daily lives. 
					Two specific topics that I am currently diving in to are cryptography and electronic linear systems. In 
					crypto, I can continue to constructively break things. Since the whole point of cryptography is to make 
					systems that can provide a secure line of data flow between users, finding ways to break cryptographic 
					objects (or failing to do so) helps with determining what methods of cryptography should be used in 
					the real world. In electronic linear systems, I've dealt with the modeling of operations on signals 
					using Fourier properties. While these systems are modeled with sets of equations, they can be applied 
					to real world situations, such as modulating a talk radio signal to a certain frequency, which can be 
					demodulated by a radio tuning in to that frequency.  
					<br>
					<br>
					In my spare time, I enjoy reading scary stories, pondering different philosophical schools of thought 
					as I strive to discover more about myself, and collecting Pokemon in hopes that I one day will complete 
					the Pokedex, even if The Pokemon Company designs more and more Pokemon every few years.
