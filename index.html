						Hello, I'm Nathan! Welcome to my portfolio page! Here, you can learn all sorts of things 
						about who I am and what I do. Let's get started! 
						<br>
						<br>
						I was the kid that always wanted to explore something new, like trying to make plasma by microwaving a 
						grape. Now, instead of breaking microwaves, I'm striving to create without the destructive side 
						effects. When the time came for college, I ended up choosing to study computer engineering, where 
						most of my accidental unwanted side effects could be fixed with a 'Ctrl+C' or a 'git revert', but where 
						I still have the opportunity to make objects light up, process outputs of ultrasonic sensors, and 
						just interact with the physical world with the things I build (even if a few LEDs or resistors are 
						sacrificed in the process). Now, I'm starting my third and final year for my Bachelor's degree, and 
						I'm on track to complete my Master's degree in computer engineering by Spring of 2022. 
						<br>
						<br>
						My current interest resides in finding and understanding the applications of theoretical principles 
						that I am learning about in my courses. I find abstract notions to be wonderful to think about, I 
						believe that the true beauty of these theoretical concepts is how they can be applied to our daily lives. 
						Two specific topics that I am currently diving in to are cryptography and electronic linear systems. In 
						crypto, I can continue to constructively break things. Since the whole point of cryptography is to make 
						systems that can provide a secure line of data flow between users, finding ways to break cryptographic 
						objects (or failing to do so) helps with determining what methods of cryptography should be used in 
						the real world. In electronic linear systems, I've dealt with the modeling of operations on signals 
						using Fourier properties. While these systems are modeled with sets of equations, they can be applied 
						to real world situations, such as modulating a talk radio signal to a certain frequency, which can be 
						demodulated by a radio tuning in to that frequency.  
						<br>
						<br>
						In my spare time, I enjoy reading scary stories, pondering different philosophical schools of thought 
						as I strive to discover more about myself, and collecting Pokemon in hopes that I one day will complete 
						the Pokedex, even if The Pokemon Company designs more and more Pokemon every few years.

						I am currently a student at UC San Diego, majoring in Computer Engineering. In the field 
						of computer science, I have taken classes on topics such as Software Engineering, Data 
						Structures, and Algorithm Analysis. Moreover, I have taken courses in the field of 
						electrical engineering, such as Analog Design and Linear Systems.

									The mission of TSE is to provide non-profits with technical solutions. 
									I have personally been on two development teams. While on the UCSD Innovation
									team, I helped develop the database structure of the interactive 
									<a href="https://innovation.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Innovation Portal</a>,
									which is currently being used by the UCSD community to find 
									opportunities in research and development. While on the Internaltional Health
									Collective team, where I contributed to patient data organization and 
									implemented the display and storage of numerical data to incorporate unit
									conversion functionality for a tablet application that will be used by 
									medical professionals in Tijuana.

									I worked under the guidance of Dr. Siavash Mirarab on measuring the 
									correctness of an error detection tool for multiple sequence alignments of
									phylogenetic data. Over the course of my research, I introduced specified 
									errors to correct datasets to determine the effectiveness of the tool under 
									different conditions and designed a pipeline to test the algorithm on 
									hundreds of input datasets. In the end, I was able to present my research
									findings at UCSD's Summer Research Conference.
