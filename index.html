						Hello, I'm Nathan! Welcome to my portfolio page! Here, you can learn all sorts of things 
						about who I am and what I do. Let's get started! 
						<br>
						<br>
						I was the kid that always wanted to explore something new, like trying to make plasma by microwaving a 
						grape. Now, instead of breaking microwaves, I'm striving to create without the destructive side 
						effects. When the time came for college, I ended up choosing to study computer engineering, where 
						most of my accidental unwanted side effects could be fixed with a 'Ctrl+C' or a 'git revert', but where 
						I still have the opportunity to make objects light up, process outputs of ultrasonic sensors, and 
						just interact with the physical world with the things I build (even if a few LEDs or resistors are 
						sacrificed in the process). Now, I'm starting my third and final year for my Bachelor's degree, and 
						I'm on track to complete my Master's degree in computer engineering by Spring of 2022. 
						<br>
						<br>
						My current interest resides in finding and understanding the applications of theoretical principles 
						that I am learning about in my courses. I find abstract notions to be wonderful to think about, I 
						believe that the true beauty of these theoretical concepts is how they can be applied to our daily lives. 
						Two specific topics that I am currently diving in to are cryptography and electronic linear systems. In 
						crypto, I can continue to constructively break things. Since the whole point of cryptography is to make 
						systems that can provide a secure line of data flow between users, finding ways to break cryptographic 
						objects (or failing to do so) helps with determining what methods of cryptography should be used in 
						the real world. In electronic linear systems, I've dealt with the modeling of operations on signals 
						using Fourier properties. While these systems are modeled with sets of equations, they can be applied 
						to real world situations, such as modulating a talk radio signal to a certain frequency, which can be 
						demodulated by a radio tuning in to that frequency.  
						<br>
						<br>
						In my spare time, I enjoy reading scary stories, pondering different philosophical schools of thought 
						as I strive to discover more about myself, and collecting Pokemon in hopes that I one day will complete 
						the Pokedex, even if The Pokemon Company designs more and more Pokemon every few years.

									In the summer after my second year at UCSD, I participated as a STEP Intern at 
									Google. As a part of this internship, I worked with two other interns in developing
									a tool for extracting important phrases and their corresponding timestamps from YouTube
									videos. The motive behind this project is to allow for fast searching through YouTube
									videos of long lectures as we begin to determine whether an online education is a 
									viable option. 
									<br>
									<br>
									I personally developed much of the backend pipelining of data through Natrual Language
									Processing (NLP) services. The main challenge behind this project lies in the maintenance of phrase
									to timestamps mapping as we send text data through the NLP services. We recognize that 
									the longer the text we parse in, the more accurate the NLP service will find words that 
									may be considered important in its context. However, as we increase the amount of text 
									that we pass in, we lose the timestamp accuracy. Manipulating the constraints of this 
									problem was one of my main focuses, as I experimented with both the theoretical mathematics
									behind this problem as well as real video data.								</p>

									The mission of TSE is to provide non-profits with technical solutions. 
									I have personally been on two development teams in my time at UCSD. 
									While on the UCSD Innovation team, I helped develop the database structure of 
									the interactive 
									<a href="https://innovation.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Innovation Portal</a>,
									which is currently being used by the UCSD community to find 
									opportunities in research and development. This structure allows easy filtering 
									of groups (i.e. Students, Faculty, and Community), as well as further filtration 
									of potential interests to each of the groups. 
									<br>
									<br>
									
									While on the Internaltional Health Collective team, I contributed to 
									patient data organization and implemented the display and storage of numerical 
									data to incorporate unit conversion functionality for a tablet application 
									that will be used by medical professionals in Tijuana. This gives users the ability
									to easily keep track of patient data without the need of a large local database or
									strong internet connection to fetch the said data. Our implementation of this 
									tablet application allows for local communication with a Raspberry Pi server that 
									stores all necessary information.

									I worked under the guidance of Dr. Siavash Mirarab on measuring the 
									correctness of an error detection tool for multiple sequence alignments of
									phylogenetic data. Over the course of my research, I introduced specified 
									errors to correct datasets to determine the effectiveness of the tool under 
									different conditions and designed a pipeline to test the algorithm on 
									hundreds of input datasets. In the end, I was able to present my research
									findings at UCSD's Summer Research Conference of 2019. 
									<br>
									<br>
									I am currently finalizing my results from the data that I have collected
									with my scripts. As of now, we have tested the effectiveness of error correcting
									on three simulated datasets as well as one real dataset of multiple sequence
									alignments. The conditions that I have tested include varying lengths of error, 
									the percentages of rows that contain error, as well as variations in the 
									algorithm parameters themselves. We are currently writing a paper in hopes
									to introduce the algorithm and publish the results.

									The summer after my senior year of high school, I studied the basics of web 
									development through Google's Computer Science Summer Institute program. This 
									included learning front end techniques in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well
									as working with a backend for data management and processing. Specifically,
									we learned to develop with a Python based back end and database querying system.

									The last week of CSSI was dedicated to developing a standalone application, where
									I collaborated with two other students to create and deploy a web application
									that tracks user inputted expiration dates of foods. Features of this application
									include stored data on foods that the user wishes to keep track of, an integrated
									UI to easily see which foods will expire the soonest, as well as Google Calendar
									notifications when foods approach their expiration dates.
